### ðŸ§  Why isn't it automatic?

Git **does not version-control the `.git/hooks/` folder**, so hook scripts aren't carried over when someone clones a repo.

That's why they must manually install hooks using `pre-commit install`.

Let me know if you want to **enforce it in CI/CD**, or **auto-check it in PRs** too!
